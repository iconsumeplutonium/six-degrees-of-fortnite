# Six Degrees of Fortnite

[Six Degrees of Fortnite](https://www.sixdegreesoffortnite.com/)  attempts to find a way to connect any franchise back to Fortnite solely through the crossovers between franchises.


Documentation can be found [here](/backend/README.md).

The idea for this project came from [this](https://i.redd.it/om9uu1humvl71.png) meme, with the site interface and interactivity heavily inspired by Jacob Wenger's [Six Degrees of Wikipedia](https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/). All crossover data is sourced from the [Fictional Crossover Wiki](https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/Crossover_Wiki) which is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/#src-same-license) license. No changes were made to the content of the scraped info itself (see the docs for how it is stored).
