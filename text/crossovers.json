In the Dexter's Laboratory episode Babysitter Blues, Lisa's pet name for Jeff is Fuzzy Lumpkins which is the name of a villain from The Powerpuff Girls. Jim from The Powerpuff Girls episode Mime for a Change also makes an appearance in the Dexter's Laboratory episode Bygone Errors. On September 17, 2021, ex-PPG writer Rob Renzetti revealed on his Twitter that he had storyboarded a Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Lab crossover a decade earlier, which he called a fanfic but this is also considered a reportedly unfinished crossover episode."
